# Visualisations for Scotben

This is a collection of HTML formatting and graphics routines for the [ScotBen](https://github.com/grahamstark/ScottishTaxBenefitModel.jl/) microsimulation models. Kept out of ScotBen to cut down large
graphics dependencies.

The routines are a bit ad-hoc and not entirely consistent. Graphics use [CairoMakie](https://docs.makie.org/stable/). HTML assumes [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

TODO better docs, consistent interfaces.
