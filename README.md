# Visualisations for Scotben

This is a collection of HTML formatting and graphics routines for the [ScotBen]() microsimulation models. Kept out of ScotBen to cut down large
graphics dependencies.

The routines are a bit ad-hoc and not entirely consistent. Graphics use [CairoMakie](). HTML assumes [Bootstrap]().

TODO better docs, consistent interfaces.
